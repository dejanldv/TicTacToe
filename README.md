## About the Project

In first and second version, user can choose to play against another opponent or against a computer, with three levels of difficulty, while in third version, user plays against a computer with higher difficulty level.

## Usage
Game is played the same way as TicTacToe board game. Players are presented a board, on which they alternately take turns by placing their mark (X or O) on one of nine positions on the board. Player who first reaches three in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) is the winner. If there are no free positions left on the board, and there is no winner, the game is a tie. At the beginning of the game, user can choose between human or computer opponent, with three levels of difficulty (in Ver2, user can change opponent or levels of difficulty mid-game).
